# ClieNT V2.0
This is a readme file about the ClieNT V2.0 Program featuring a fully functional Port Scanner tool and an SSH Brute Forcer created by ADIOP Team.All rights reserved 2024.
Basic Instructions on how to use this program.
You have 3 options in the main menu
1 is to start port scanner
2 is to start SSH Brute Forcer
3 is to exit program 

Let's Begin with the Port Scanner
Port Scanner utilizes a variety of python libraries in order to scan for open ports in an IP address. 
First you enter the IP address that you want to be scanned or the addresses seperated by ","
After hitting enter the process starts until it displays the open ports.
When done by pressing ENTER it returns to the main menu 


Second tool is the SSH Brute Forcer

SSH Brute Forcer works in a way that it connects to the host address given by the user following the SSH protocol
Then by using a variety of libraries it connects to the SSH port 22 with the already created passwords file enriched by the rockyou.txt from Kali Linux including every possible combination!
After all this is done, it tries to connect using Brute Force to retrieve the password used to achieve an SSH connection
With an appropriate message it notifies the user what the password is for the user requested.
The user the only thing that needs to do is to enter the SSH address that he/she wants to attack and the according username
Then the program runs on its own until it returns a result.

Thank you very much for using our software!Improvements coming in future versions!
